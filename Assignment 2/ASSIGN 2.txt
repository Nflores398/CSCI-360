    d.  E2C
	   -AB1
	    37B
	
6.	Do the following arithmetic as if these were five-bit signed representations and indicate if overflow occurs and, if so, why.
 Note:  Remember that you want to add.  So, for signed subtraction, always convert the subtrahend (the number being subtracted) to its 2's complement and add it.
 Do this whether or not the subtrahend is negative OR positive and still check for overflow!  (8 points)
